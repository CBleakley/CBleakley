### AI Speech & Language Therapist

HackEurope 2026 project for Europe’s largest student hackathon. Built an agentic AI speech and language therapist for stroke rehabilitation using ElevenLabs voice cloning and a high-quality voice library to deliver therapy in a personalised accent. Grounded in academic research showing accent can influence stroke rehab outcomes.
